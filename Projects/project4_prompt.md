**`Project 4 - Flappy Bird`**

### Flappy Bird
- For this project, we will be creating an HTML version of the "Flappy Bird" game.

### Requirements (90pts)
- Three main files: `index.html`, `script.js`, and `styls.css` .
- The HTML page will use a JavaScript canvas to present the game screen.
- The player will use a set of controls (keypad, mouse, or both) to move their bird.
- Obstacles will move left across the screen.
- If a collision is detected between the bird and an obstacle, the game ends or a life is removed.
- A score will be given (and displayed) to the player, based on how long their bird has stayed alive.

### Bonus Points (10pts)
- Inclusion of custom images, art, or other graphics for the game pieces.
- Multiple lives and a life counter display.
- Any other orignal flavor!

### Expectations
- Each person in the class will demonstrate their project.
- You will have one month to create your project.
- When you demo your project, you will share your files and explain their code.
