**`Project 1 - Choose Your Own Adventure Game`**

### Choose Your Own Adventure
- For this project, we will be creating a simple "Choose your own adventure" game.
- The game involves designing a series of web pages where each page offers choices that lead to different outcomes.
- To start this project, you will want to first create a decision tree diagram.
- You can start by planning the structure on paper or using a digital tool, like `draw.io`, etc.
- Next, you should create a template HTML page and then copy it for each choice in your story.
- This will allow you to build a branching narrative where each choice leads to a different path in the story.

### Requirements (90pts)
- This game will be a seperate project from your current weekly website.
- The game must have its own folder and `.css` file.
- One template `.html` file.
- One or more decision tree diagrams. 
- A minimum of 10 HTML pages.
- A minimum of 5 image files.
- The game should tell a story, and have a minimum of 3 potential outcomes.

### Bonus Points (10pts)
- Add colors to text, background, etc.
- Add styling, color, or animations to the links/buttons.

### Expectations
- Each person in the class will demonstrate their project.
- You will have one month to create your project.
- When you demo your project, you will share your file structure, template, diagram, and a walk-through of the game.
