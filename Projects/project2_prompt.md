**`Project 2 - Image Carousel`**

### Image Carousel
- For this project, we will be creating a simple image carousel using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- The idea is to have a webpage that displays images, which a user can scroll through.


### Requirements (90pts)
- Three main files: `index.html`, `script.js`, and `styls.css` .
- At least three image files.
- The carousel should allow a user to scroll through the images (left and right).
- There should be a left and a right button to go forward or reverse through the images.
- A function to initially show the first slide.
- A function to move the slide in a direction.
- A function to check whether a move is valid, and adjust the image index if needed.


### Bonus Points (10pts)
- Include a thumbnail or other indicator for the current slide.
- Add automatic slide scrolling.
- Any other orignal flavor!


### Expectations
- Each person in the class will demonstrate their project.
- You will have one month to create your project.
- When you demo your project, you will share your files and explain their code.
