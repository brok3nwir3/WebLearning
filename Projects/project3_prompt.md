**`Project 3 - Geolocation API`**

### Geolocation API
- For this project, we will be creating an HTML page that generates a table of geolocation information via API.
- The idea is to have a webpage that displays at least one geolocation datapoint, using JavaScript and a free API.

### Requirements (90pts)
- Three main files: `index.html`, `script.js`, and `styls.css` .
- At least one API call is made.
- You can choose how you want the API call to be made...
- For example, you can have the API call be made via a button click, or any time the page is loaded.
- At least one HTML table is created and/or populated using JavaScript.

### Bonus Points (10pts)
- Inclusion of more than one piece of geolocation data.
- On-page map or other visual.
- Any other orignal flavor!

### Expectations
- Each person in the class will demonstrate their project.
- You will have one month to create your project.
- When you demo your project, you will share your files and explain their code.
