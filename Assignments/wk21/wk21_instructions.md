## JavaScript

### Question 1 - HTML Canvas Element & JavaScript Drawing
- *This question introduces the HTML canvas element.*
  - *HTML*
- Create a new HTML file or copy of one of your website HTML files, and name it `wk21.html`.
- Inside the HTML file, create one new canvas element within the body.
- Add the `id` attribute to the paragraph element, and set the value `Q1`.
- The canvas element should be closed without any text inside.
- Set the canvas to have a `height` attribute of `700` and a `width` attribute of `700`.
- Set the canvas to have a `style` attribute with `2` pixel border, `solid`, with color `#164996`.
- Below the canvas element, add a script element.
- Add the source attribute to the script element, and set it to `wk21.js`.
- Save the HTML file, and check if your canvas is displaying correctly.
  - *JavaScript*
- Note: Refer to the following page if you get stuck: https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_drawing.asp
- Create a new JavaScript file, name it `wk21.js`, and open it.
- Within the JavaScript file, initialize a *constant* variable named, `canvas`.
- Set the `canvas` variable to a `getElementById` for `Q1`.
- Next, initialize a *constant* variable named, `ctx` (context).
- Set the `ctx` variable to a `"2d"` canvas context.
- Next, set `ctx` to have a `fillStyle` of `"green"`.
- Then, draw a rectangle, i.e. `fillRect` with the dimension `150` by `70`.
- Place the rectangle at an X position of `10` and a Y position of `100`.
- Save the file, and check if your rectangle is displaying correctly.

### Question 2 - Coordinates and Drawing Lines
- We will continue using the `Q1` canvas, so no changes will be made to the `wk21.html` file.
  - *JavaScript*
- Within your `wk21.js` file...
- Read the following page: https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_lines.asp
- Based on the information from your reading, create two new line drawings on the canvas.
- Position the two new lines create a black X going through the green rectangle you made in question 1.
- The two lines should appear to start and end in the corners of the rectangle.
- Save the file, and check if your lines are displaying correctly.
