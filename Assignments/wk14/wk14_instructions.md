## JavaScript

### Question 1 - Let & Const
  - *Setup...*
- Create a new HTML file or copy of one of your website HTML files, and name it `wk14.html`.
- Also create a new JavaScript file, and name it `wk14.js`.
- Inside the HTML file, create a new paragraph element within the body.
- Add the ID attribute to the paragraph, and set it to `question_1`.
- Below the paragraph element, add a script element.
- Add the source attribute to the script element, and set it to `wk14.js`.
- Save the HTML file, and open the JavaScript file.
  - *JS Question*
- Within the JavaScript declare three variables: `myString`, `myInt`, and `myUndef`.
- Initialize `myString` equal to `test`, `myInt` equal to `123`, and leave `myUndef` uninitialized.
- Next, create a function called `typeTest`, which takes in one variable: `x`.
- Within the function, you'll have one `if`, one `else if`, and one `else` statements.
- The `if` statement checks if `x` is `typeof` string, and returns `x is a string` when true.
- The `else if` statement checks if `x` is `typeof` number, and returns `x is a number` when true.
- And the `else` statement returns `x is not an integer or string` when true.
- Next, add a get element by ID statement for your output.
- Set the ID to `question_1`, and set the output to display `typeTest()` for each of the three variables, on their own lines.
- Save the file, and check if your output is displaying correctly.
