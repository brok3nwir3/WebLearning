**`Week 18 - JavaScript String Methods, String Search, and toString); AWS GuardDuty`**

## JavaScript

### Question 1 - Escaping Within Strings
- The following questions will focus on string usage and manipulation.
  - *HTML*
- Create a new HTML file or copy of one of your website HTML files, and name it `wk18.html`.
- Inside the HTML file, create one new paragraph element within the body.
- Add the `id` attribute to the paragraph element, and set the value `Q1`.
- The paragraph element should be closed without any text inside.
- Below the paragraph element, add a script element.
- Add the source attribute to the script element, and set it to `wk18.js`.
- Save the HTML file.
  - *JavaScript*
- Create a new JavaScript file, name it `wk18.js`, and open it.
- Within the JavaScript file, initialize an string named, `string1`.
- Set `string1` to: `"The "GOAT" is the greatest of all time."`.
- Next, you'll need to escape the inner double quote characters.
- Once you've done this, write a get element by ID statement.
- The statement should target ID `Q1` and be set to `string1`.
- Save the file, and check if your string is displaying correctly.
