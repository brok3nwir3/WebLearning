# WebLearning
##### Learn AWS and web programming with this repo!
> _This repo was created to help individuals with tech or programming backgrounds learn AWS and web coding for free.
 This repo assumes you have a basic understanding of computer networking, programming, and cloud computing.
 It is my sincere hope that this content aids you in your learning journey and challenges you to improve your skills.
 I maintain this project by myself and really appreciate any donations (see below)._

## Usage
Open the [Assignments](https://github.com/brok3nwir3/WebLearning/tree/main/Assignments) folder and start following the instructions (beginning at week 1). Some weeks might also include questions. You can find the answer to questions in the answer key file, which is located in the same folder. Additionally, small projects and quizzes are assigned every few weeks, to aid in your learning. Quiz answers can be located in the [Quizzes & Tests](https://github.com/brok3nwir3/WebLearning/tree/main/Quizzes%20%26%20Tests) folder.

_Note: Your code might have some differences from the official answers for assignments or projects. This is normal and expected due to the many options for solving coding problems. As long as your code achieves the same end goal, it is considered correct._

## Textbook
The AWS portions of this course build on the material covered in, ["AWS Certified Solutions Architect Study Guide"](https://a.co/d/1GcSBtC) by Ben Piper and David Clinton. While the textbook is not required, it will provide detailed explanations for the topics covered in the course exercises. 

## Setup
 1. Install an interactive development environment (IDE), such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). ...Psst! It's free to download/use!
 2. Install and/or update Git. If you don't know how, click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
 3. Create a folder for your GitHub projects (if you don't have one already).
 4. Inside your GitHub project folder, clone this repo. Use this command: `git clone https://github.com/brok3nwir3/WebLearning.git`
 6. Once you've cloned this repo, you can start working on the first assignment (wk1_instructions.md).
